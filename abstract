This paper proposes an Advanced Smart Traffic
Management System (ASTMS) leveraging advanced Internet of
Things (IoT) sensors, real-time computer vision, and predictive
analytics to address urban traffic congestion. This work
combines the Kalman Filter and the You Only Look Once (YOLO)
algorithm to create a real-time vehicle identification, tracking,
and counting system. Utilizing YOLO (You Only Look Once) for
real-time vehicle detection and Kalman Filters for predictive
traffic light control, the STMS maximizes traffic efficiency and
congestion relief. The system applies weather analytics, eventbased rerouting, and emergency vehicle priority for enhanced
safety and mobility. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
are utilized to predict traffic patterns for proactive signal
control. An easy-to-use mobile app provides real-time traffic
status, recommends alternate routes, and incorporates a
feedback module for continuous improvement. The proposed
initiative advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
through the promotion of environmentally sustainable traffic
management, reduced emissions, and enhanced
responsiveness in emergencies. An easy-to-use mobile app

STMS is a major step toward constructing “smart cities with
intelligent, adaptive, and sustainable traffic policy.”
